#PowerBI Visual Tools (pbiviz)

This guide is meant to provide the quickest path to creating a custom visual.

##Basic Setup

The easiest way to create custom visuals is by using the PowerBI command line tools which can be easily to installed via NPM.

####Dependencies

Before you can run (or install) the command line tools you must install NodeJS.

* NodeJS 4.0+ Required (5.0 recommended) - [Download NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)


####Installation

To install the command line tools simply run the following command

```
npm install -g pbiviz
```

To confirm it was installed correctly you can run the command without any paremeters which should display the help screen.

```
pbiviz
```

##Creating a new visual

You can create a new visual project with a single command.

```
pbiviz new My Visual Name
```

Replace "My Visual Name" with the name of your visual. You can change this later by modifying the generated `pbiviz.json` file.

This command will create a new folder in your current directory and generate a basic starter template for your visual. Once it finishes you can open the directory and use your favorite editor to start working on your new visual.

##Testing your visual in PowerBI

You can easily test your visual live in reports and dashboards in the PowerBI service

####Server certificate setup

To enable live preview visual assets need to be served on a trusted https server so before you can start you need to install an ssl certificate which will allow visual asssets to load in your web browser. This is a one time setup.

* [How to install the local SSL certificates](docs/CertificateAddWindows.md) 

####Running your visual

To run your visual navigate to the root of your visual project (the directory containing `pbiviz.json`) and type `pbiviz start` to build and serve the visual.

This command will compile your [typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [less](http://lesscss.org/) files and bundle them for testing. It also launches an https server that will serve your visual for testing in your favorite web browser.

####Enable developer visual

To view/test your visual in PowerBI you need to enable the development visual and then you can add it to any report.

##Packaging your Visual for distribution

Before you can load your visual into [PowerBI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/) or share it with the community in the [PowerBI Visual Gallery](https://visuals.powerbi.com) you'll need to generate a `pbiviz` file.

To package your visual navigate to the root of your visual project (the directory containing `pbiviz.json`) and use the following command to generate a pbiviz file.

```
pbiviz package
```

This command will create a pbiviz file in the `dist/` directory of your visual project. If there is already a pbiviz file (from previous package operations) it will be overwritten.
